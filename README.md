For new people here's the basics:
1. Rockford-East-Robotics is a repository (a project) 

2. If you're going to edit something from the main branch, make a new branch.

3. In your branch you can go different ways:
  - If you want to edit an existing file, click on that file and make your changes, try not to delete everything and copy and paste your code, not very helpful when you make a pull request and try to compare th old code with the new code.
  - If you want to upload a new file you can have a choice between CREATE, UPLOAD, and FIND.
  
4. After you've done your changes, open a pull request.

5. Select the branch you made to compare with master (the original). Look over changes until satisfied.

6. Click the big green 'Create Pull Request' button.

7. Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
  -Please comment your work for the sake of everyone.
  
8. click 'Create pull request'
